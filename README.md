## Description

Just a proof of concept.. i like the look of blurry and transparent windows.. but i dont like how much gpu they use. so i had i ideia of blurring the wallpaper instead.. almost zero gpu use.. just update the wallpaper on the fly, i have almost zero js skills, just was made for me, and maybe can be useful for you, feel free to use the ideia in your own extension!
